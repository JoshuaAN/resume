\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Nick Asendorf and I currently manage the Machine Learning and Data Science team
in 3M's Corporate Research System Lab (CRSL). CRSL is a lab of 150 researchers with
backgrounds spanning mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering,
and machine learning. We are tasked with developing technologies and building capabilities
to drive new products to our divisions, who sell the 50,000 products 3M is known for. The team that I manage is a cross functional team of 20 ML and AI researchers, with
backgrounds in computer science, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, applied
mathematics, and neuroscience. Our active areas of research focus on generative modeling
for inverse product design, computer vision for healthcare and manufacturing applications,
active learning for material discovery, and optimization of manufacturing processes. 

I have a PhD in statistical signal processing from the University of Michigan. My thesis
centered around developing data fusion algorithms for multimodal data, particularly in
low-sample-high-dimensionality settings in the presence of noise. Leveraging advances in
random matrix theory, we developed algorithms better able to detect and estimate signals
in such settings. After graduate school, I joined the AI team in CRSL that I currently
manage. As an individual contributor, I led a team developing a deep learning application
to detect counterfeit products, collaborated with our Health Information System Division
to develop algorithms for population health analytics, and worked across multiple
corporate organizations developing algorithms for sales assignment, supply chain
optimization, and weathering of materials.

After about 3 years as an individual contributor, I switched to management. 3M is a
historical manufacturing, chemistry, and material science company and as such, much of its
management have deep expertise in those disciplines. I was motivated to bring my unique
background to management to technically develop our AI and ML teams and to advocate on
the team's behalf for what is possible in the AI and ML space. In these roles, I worked
with global colleagues with incredibly diverse scientific expertise (molecular
dynamics, spectroscopy, medical documentation, nonwovens, abrasives, pressure sensitive
adhesives, optical metamaterials) to champion machine learning and AI capabilities
and build strategies for these technologies to have the largest impact for 3M.

\lettersection{What's Next?}  
% MANAGER %
%I am looking for a new management position with an
%organization that knows how to strategically prioritize, has a commitment to develop and

%that will have real world scientific impact.

% IC %
I am looking to lead and manage an AI/ML team and am also open to move to an individual
contributor position. I am looking for an organization that knows how to strategically
prioritize, has a commitment to develop and implement an AI and ML vision and strategy,
and has teams motivated to tackle any problem they face. I am not interested in developing
algorithms that promote war or improve the click through rates of ads. I am energized by
building teams and executing strategies that will have real world impact that improves
lives.
