\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
After completing my civil service duty, I moved from Germany to the Netherlands to study medical biology in Nijmegen. 
I completed my bachelor’s degree and began my master's in medical biology at the Radboud University. 
During this time, both in- and outside of university, I focused on developing IT skills such as setting up and managing headless Linux systems, programming with a focus on bioinformatics, machine learning and dynamic websites. 
I honed my bioinformatic skills during my master's internships in the Radboud UMC human genetics department, as well as in the comparative genomics group. 
Due to financial and personal reasons, I started working in logistics and was unable to finish my master’s degree. 
However, I am determined to pursue my passion for human biology and IT and work in a field that allows me to utilize my potential while having a greater societal impact.
Apart from my professional goals, I enjoy going to concerts, bouldering, and most importantly, spending time with my friends and family.
\lettersection{Why Computational Research Technician at WUR:}
As a computational research technician at WUR I could combine two fields I am passionate about and work in biology and technolgy.
WUR is a world class University where cutting-edge research takes place and generated knowledge is translated into biotechnological, medical and environmental applications.
As a trained biologist with background in human biology who is keen on technology, I would be glad to join your team and tackle the technical/coding aspects in your department as well as supporting staff members with problems they may face.
This vacancy promotes a clean code policy that adheres to FAIR principles, which I am also passionate about because it is pivotal for efficient, robust and reproducible research.
I value collaborating with international and interdisciplinary teams to exchange knowledge and provide support to each others.
I am confident that this is possible at WUR and more so in an inclusive and diverse working environment.
Therefore, I would like to join your team at the Systems and Synthetic Biology department at WUR.
\lettersection{Why Me?}
While my career path may not have been straightforward, I have gained a lot of experience along the way, making me the ideal candidate for this position. 
I am not only highly motivated to work in diagnostics with big sequencing-data and big computers, but I also possess the necessary technical skills for working on server infrastructure, with large amounts of data and analyzing complex omics data.
As such, I have experience in setting up and working with headless Linux systems and containerized applications, as well as programming/scripting in R, Python, bash and the command line.
I have used numerous Bioconductor packages and command-line tools commonly used in bioinformatic analysis. 
Developing my own R package (see CV), working on hobby projects and supporting friends and peers on technical issues have given me ample troubleshooting experience. 
Furthermore, I have experience in communicating bioinformatic methods and results to researchers, regardless of their background in bioinformatics.
I am intrinsically motivated to learn and take pride in my autodidacticism, which has enabled me to acquire most of the skills presented in my CV. 
While I value being able to work independently, I also appreciate having knowledgeable peers around to discuss stubborn problems. 
As a hands-on and down-to-earth person, as well as a hard worker, I would be pleased to meet with you in March.
