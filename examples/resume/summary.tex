  My background is in statistical signal processing - some call this machine learning,
  others data science, others data analytics. Regardless of the buzzword or nomenclature,
  I approach projects by asking two fundamental questions: What data do you have and what
  problem are you trying to solve? For the past year, I've managed a team of software
  engineers. This foray into management has allowed me to improve my leadership skills,
  hone my management style, and develop the culture I try to instill. I am looking to
  manage a software team for a company with a clear vision and roadmap, the ability to
  strategically prioritize, and a team of brilliant engineers with the tenacity to make it
  all happen.
