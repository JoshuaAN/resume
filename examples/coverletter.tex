\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
After my civil service duty I moved from Germany to the Netherlands in order to study medical biology in Nijmegen. After finishing my bachelor studies I started my masters in medical biology.
For financial and personal reasons, I could not finish my master studies with diploma.
However, I finished the mandatory two internships and the bulk of the courses.
I started working in logistics to finance myself and my studies.
What supposed to be a temporary solution to my financial situation turned out to be detrimental to the remainder of my study and to be a longer endeavor - lasting 4 years.
Although having a lot of really nice colleagues and superiors, which value me as a person and employee, I need changes in my life.
I want to work in a field that I am deeply interested in and which is more meaningful to me than logistics.

\lettersection{Why GenomeScan?}
I saw your "Bioinformatics Analyst" position on a recruiting platform and could immediately identify myself with this job. 
General interest in biology and tech, the pandemic and the incurable cancer my dad recently succumbed to, motivates me to apply for this job and to hopefully play a role in the cutting edge research and diagnostics at GenomeScan.
I want to learn all the ins and outs of the latest ngs technologies, data analysis and data processing pipelines from professionals. 
I'd like to be involved in the development of software, enabling your company to deliver reliable, reproducible and meaningful results to your customers and for your research projects.
Given GenomeScan's ISO certificates, received funds and research projects it is involved in, I have no doubt I am at the right place.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe I am the ideal candidate for this job, because I have proven technical and cognitive skills to perform and analyze complex omics data as can be seen from my internship reports.
I have experience in communicating bioinformatical methods and resuls to researchers with no bioinformatic background, which comes in handy for working with clients not so familiar with bioinformatics. 
I am eager to learn and I am proud of my autodidacticism through which I gained most of the knownlege presented in my CV.
I don't like idling, I am hands-on and down to earth person as well as a hard worker.
I'd be pleased if you consider my application.
