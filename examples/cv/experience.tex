        \item {Created a risk assessment tool to predict which HIV+ patients are likely to drop out of care for use by the University of Chicago HIV clinic.}
        \item {Deployed a machine learning model for predicting which homes in the city of Chicago are likely to have lead hazards that lead to early childhood lead poisoning. This was in  partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Innovation and Technology and Alliance HealthCare. This work was awarded the Academy Health Local/State Innovation Prize.}
         \item {Built and deployed an early warning machine learning model to identify which city blocks were most at risk of having water main breaks for the city of Syracuse, NY. This work has been featured in State Scoop, Water Online, and Politico.}
         \item {Developed a point-of-service model for predicting general recidivism for the Illinois Department of Corrections. Conducted a retrospective study to understand the effect of technical recidivism violations on an offender's ability to obtain future employment.}
