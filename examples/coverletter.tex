\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
After my civil service duty, I moved from Germany to the Netherlands in order to study medical biology in Nijmegen. 
After finishing my bachelor studies, I started my master's in medical biology - medical epigenomics track.
For financial and personal reasons, I could not finish my master studies with diploma.
However, I finished the mandatory two internships - during which I taught myself bioinformatics - and the bulk of the courses.
I started working in logistics to finance myself and my studies.
What supposed to be a temporary solution to my financial situation turned out to be detrimental to the remainder of my study and to be a longer endeavor - lasting 4 years.
Although having a lot of really nice colleagues and superiors, which value me as a person and employee, I want a change in my life and start following my passion again.
I want to work in a field that I am deeply interested in, and which is more meaningful to me.
\lettersection{Why The Department of Preventive Dentistry at ACTA and Data Science Centre of the University of Amsterdam DSC UvA?}
I hope at ACTA and DSC UvA, I could pursue my passion and get back working in the field of next-generation sequencing and data-analysis and to finally start off my career in bioinformatics.
Within the Personal Microbiome Health research priority area, as well as for the METAHEALTH project, I could put my skills to use and establish user friendly SOPs for next-generation sequencing data-handling and analysis, by using frameworks like nextflow, snakemate or cwl.
Furthermore, at ACTA and the DSC UvA, I would like to share and expand my skill set within a highly motivated and knowledgeable group of peers.
\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe that I am the ideal candidate for this job, because I have proven technical skills to perform and analyse omics data.
Moreover I have experience with implementing and packaging a workflow into an R package.
I strongly agree with FAIR data principles and believe that standardised workflows are fundamental for reproducible research and high quality results.
As such I am keen on learning the ins and outs in metagenomics analysis and delving into data analysis frameworks for reproducible data analysis.
I am proud of my autodidacticism which allowed me to develop most of the skills presented in my CV.
I don't like idling, I am a hands-on and down to earth person as well as a hard worker.
I'd be pleased if you consider my application.
