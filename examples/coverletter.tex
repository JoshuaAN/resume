\lettersection{About Me}
I am a passionate master's student in my last year in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for my dream job at a company I admire.

As a person, I am:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Social and open-minded. I love meeting and working with new people.
  \item Self-motivated. I find great joy in creating things that I can see the value in using myself.
  \item Hard-working. I enjoy the challenge of keeping technology simple and ensuring that the result lives up to the expectations of my imagination.
  \item Fast learner. I am eager to learn, and if there is something I do not understand, I am not shy to ask for help.
  \item Responsible. I find pride in my work and team, and I take responsibility for both.
  \item Team player. I enjoy working in a well-structured team with high expectations and a straightforward tone, where it is acceptable to bring my ideas and suggestions.
\end{itemize}.\vspace*{-\baselineskip}\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\lettersection{Why Umbraco?}
Umbraco's strong position in the CMS market, with a platform that runs on the .NET Framework, is of great interest to me. 

I believe Umbraco's focus on open-source software is inspirational. Focusing on sharing knowledge and being transparent with end-users is very important. Delivering value to customers is all about listening, and in this regard, transparency is critical.

Furthermore, Umbraco's focus on developer freedom for end-users is cool. Creating flexible and extendible software is hard, and it requires an interest in keeping the complexity low. Having this focus is something I am interested in.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe my personality, experience, and interests align well with Umbraco's vision. I have an interest in open-source software and CMS systems. I use a lot of my time on GitHub, where I frequently use and contribute to various projects — being able to contribute with my skills and experience on something as cool as the Umbraco CMS would be a dream come true.
