  My background is in statistical signal processing - some call this machine
  learning, others data science, others artificial intelligence. Regardless of
  the buzzword, I approach projects by asking two fundamental questions: What
  problem are you trying to solve and what data do you have? For the
  past few years, I've managed teams of software engineers and AI researchers.
  This experience has allowed me to sharpen my leadership skills, hone my
  management style, and develop the culture I try to instill. I am looking to
  build and manage a machine learning team for a company with the ability to
  strategically prioritize, committment to develop and implement a
  compelling vision, and tenacity to make it happen.
