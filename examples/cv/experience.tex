      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {I studied transcription factor binding and CTCF motifs in context of CTCF mediated chromatin loops.}
        \item {To conduct this study I used publicly available ChIA-PET, Hi-C and ChIP-Seq data.}
        \item {Initially this analysis was quite difficult for me because I started without a clear hypothesis.
              However, after some digging and thinking I made good progress resulting in a great report as well as a co-authorship.}
        \item {My biggest take away from this project probbably is that persistance pays off. 
        Furthermore, I could make use of methods I had not used before. E.g. I simulated chromatin loops given particular constrains,
        applied dimensionality reduction (PCA), made use of clustering and learned about different distance measures.}
