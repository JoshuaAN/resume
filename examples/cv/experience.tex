        \item {I created a risk assessment tool to predict which HIV+ patients are likely to drop out of care for use by the University of Chicago HIV clinic. Awarded over \$50,000 for an initial pilot study.}
        \item {I deployed into production a machine learning model for predicting which homes in the city of Chicago are likely to have lead hazards that lead to early childhood lead poisoning, in partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Innovation and Technology and Alliance HealthCare. This work was awarded the Academy Health Local/State Innovation Prize.}
         \item {I created an early warning machine learning model to identify which city blocks were most at risk of having water main breaks for the city of Syracuse, NY. This work has been featured in State Scoop, Water Online, and Politico.}
         \item {Developed a point-in-service predictive model for predicting general and technical recidivism for the Illinois Department of Corrections. Also did a retrospective study to understand the effect of technical recidivism violations on offender's ability to obtain employment.}
         \item{Developed and taught the curriculum for the Coleridge Initiative, a 3-month long course to train the heads of city and state government agencies on how to use data science methods to solve public policy problems. Topics include Shell Scripting, Python, Git, SQL, GIS Analysis, Text Analysis, Network Analysis, Machine Learning, Inference, and Ethics.}
